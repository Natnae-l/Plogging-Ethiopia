            <p>Plogging-Ethiopia traces its origins back to a family excursion that spanned more than five years before officially launching in January 2021 at Entoto Park, Addis Ababa. The individuals behind this initiative are Firew Kefyalew, a father, and his three sons – Yeab, Lihiq, and Amnen. Plogging-Ethiopia goes beyond simply collecting trash; it represents a dynamic movement that combines physical fitness, community involvement, and environmental responsibility. The concept, originating from Sweden, quickly gained momentum as Firew and a growing community of volunteers realized its potential to make a meaningful impact in Ethiopia. Our dedicated volunteers, comprising students and professionals alike, unite under a shared objective: fostering a healthier Ethiopia by tackling plastic pollution and advocating for an active way of life.</p>
